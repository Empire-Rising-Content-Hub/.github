## Empire Rising SDK

Please use this for your own development of worlds within the face of mankind universe.

I will update this as we go along with some more instructions.

* You can open up all of the original map files for this version, change them, add new objects, create new areas, break them down and put them back together and then compile them to be used, we can provide you access to the dev-test server to test these versions in real time.
* You can build new maps on the Lithtech Jupiter engine to be used in empire rising from scratch using our SDK Tools
* We have de-compiled all of the models from .LTB to .LTA and can open them up in modelEdit or the included plugins to check them out, programs that can be used for examples (3D Maya, Blender)
